            vision.</p>
          <p>Beyond the chair, we are committed to giving back to our community, championing sustainability in our
            products and practices, and fostering an inclusive environment where all hair types, textures, and styles
            are embraced. Great hair care should be accessible, personal, and uplifting — and that's what we strive to
